# StocSum
Stochastic summary statistics for whole genome sequencing studies

## Description
StocSum is a novel reference-panel-free statistical framework for generating, managing, and analyzing stochastic summary statistics using random vectors. It is implemented in various downstream applications, including single-variant tests, conditional association tests, gene-environment interaction tests, variant set tests, as well as meta-analysis and LD score regression tools. 

## Installing
StocSum links to R packages <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp">Rcpp</a> and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo">RcppArmadillo</a>, and also imports R packages <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp">Rcpp</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CompQuadForm">CompQuadForm</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach">foreach</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing">parallel</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html">data.table</a>, methods, Bioconductor packages <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SeqArray.html">SeqArray</a> and <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SeqVarTools.html">SeqVarTools</a>. In addition, StocSum requires <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat">testthat</a> to run code checks during development, and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doMC">doMC</a> to run parallel computing (however, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doMC">doMC</a> is not available on Windows and these functions will switch to a single thread). These dependencies should be installed before installing StocSum.

For optimal computational performance, it is recommended to use an R version configured with the Intel Math Kernel Library (or other fast BLAS/LAPACK libraries). See the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-mkl-with-r">instructions</a> on building R with Intel MKL.
