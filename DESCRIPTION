Title: StocSum(Stochastic Summary statistics for whole genome
        sequencing studies)

Description: StocSum is a novel reference-panel-free statistical framework for generating, managing, and analyzing stochastic summary statistics using random vectors. Instead of using external reference panel, StocSum introduces a stochastic summary statistic from study samples to represent the between-variant correlation or LD matrices. It is implemented to various downstream applications, including single-variant tests, conditional association tests, gene-environment interaction tests, variant set tests, as well as meta-analysis and LD score regression tools.
